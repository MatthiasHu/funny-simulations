# Funny Simulations

A set of small physical simulations, usually allowing some user interaction,
made with Python 3 and pygame.


## Running one of the Simulation

Have Python 3 and pygame installed, then just run one of the python files:

```bash
$ python3 elastic-collisions/bouncing-balls.py
```

Ways of interaction can only be found out about in the code.
